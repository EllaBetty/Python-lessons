Since Django 2.0 the ForeignKey field requires two positional arguments:

the model to map to
the on_delete argument
categorie = models.ForeignKey('Categorie', on_delete=models.PROTECT)
Here are some methods can used in on_delete

CASCADE
Cascade deletes. Django emulates the behavior of the SQL constraint ON DELETE CASCADE and also deletes the object containing the ForeignKey

PROTECT
Prevent deletion of the referenced object by raising ProtectedError, a subclass of django.db.IntegrityError.

DO_NOTHING
Take no action. If your database backend enforces referential integrity, this will cause an IntegrityError unless you manually add an SQL ON DELETE constraint to the database field.

you can find more about on_delete by reading the documentation.
